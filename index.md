## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 3 , part 2
  
  I enjoyed lab 3 part 2 because this was one of the first programs I ever did with coding, and it was so awesome knowing the code we used to implement dates like it can tell us how many days it has been since I was born. What I learned was simple, I did not know computers can do math for you which when I found out, I was fascinated.  

 

* Lab 4, part 2

  My second favorite lab was lab 4 part 2 because we created a silly game on which we can play by guessing a number and inputting it and telling us if the number we input was correct or not. What I learned was that if statements can be useful and can be used in many ways.  

 

* Lab 6, part 2

  My last favorite lab was lab 6 part 2 because we created a blackjack game which kept score of your cards. What I learned was how to play blackjack since I never knew how to play and now, I can play blackjack with my friends!
